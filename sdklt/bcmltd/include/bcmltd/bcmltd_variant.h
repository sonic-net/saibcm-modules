 * \brief BCMLTD Variant initerfaces and definitions
 *
 * Logical table variant inclusion and exclusion support within the
 * BCMLTD can be specified as a combination of the following defines:
 *
 *     #define BCMLTD_CONFIG_INCLUDE_<CHIPNAME>_<REV>X_<VARIANT> [1|0]
 *           -- Include or exclude the specified variant
 *           Example: #define BCMLTD_CONFIG_INCLUDE_BCM56880_UTLTM    1
 *
 * The value of BCMLTD_CONFIG_INCLUDE_VARIANT_DEFAULT is used for any
 * variants which are left unspecified. Set this value to 1 or 0 to
 * include or exclude all variants by default.
 *
 * BCMLTD_VARIANT_ENTRY macros.
 *
 * If a list of variant entries is needed, before including this file,
 * define BCMLTD_VARIANT_ENTRY as a macro to operate on the following
 * parameters:
 *
 *     #define BCMLTD_VARIANT_ENTRY(_bd,_bu,_va,_ve,_vu,_vv,_vo,_vd,_r0,_r1)
 *
 *     _bd: SW Base Driver (lower case)
 *     _bu: SW Base Driver (upper case)
 *     _va: Variant name (lower case or empty for BASE)
 *     _ve: Variant enum symbol (upper case)
 *     _vu: Variant name (underscore or empty for BASE)
 *     _vv: Variant numeric value
 *     _vo: Device relative offset
 *     _vd: Variant Description
 *     _r0: Reserved
 *     _r1: Reserved
