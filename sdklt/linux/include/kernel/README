This directory is mainly for the header files which are planned
for upstreaming to the mainline kernels.
The header files can be placed in the simulated kernel include path
created in this directory.

The directory (include/kernel) can be added to the include path (-I)
when compiling the associated source files such that the standard Linux path
can be used in the source files.
